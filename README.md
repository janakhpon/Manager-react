 Sorry this project is not completely done yet and only a few features are available. If you are considering about cloning this project please wait till it's completed.

## Description
 If you wanna try it on your own clone the `SERVER-SIDE-REPOSITORY` first then use your own `MONGO_URI` then run `start` or `dev` whatever u like and if it went without errors clone this `CLIENT-SIDE` repo and start the application. I'm sure there will be a few or more errors as this project is completely done for both `CLIENT` and `SERVER`.
