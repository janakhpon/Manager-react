 Sorry this project is not completely done yet and only a few features are available. If you are considering about cloning this project please wait till it's completed.

## Description
 If you wanna try it on your own then clone the `SERVER-SIDE-REPOSITORY` first then use your own `MONGO_URI` then run `start` or `dev` whatever u like and if it went without errors then clone this `CLIENT-SIDE` repo and start the application. I'm sure there will be a few or more errors as this project is not completely done for both `CLIENT` and `SERVER`. I would appreciate if you fork it on your own acc then tweet as u like!.
